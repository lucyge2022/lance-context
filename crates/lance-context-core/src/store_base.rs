//! Shared low-level storage layer for every fixed-schema store.
//!
//! [`StorageBase`] owns everything about talking to Lance that is not
//! schema-specific: opening/creating the dataset, the resident MemWAL
//! [`ShardWriter`] lifecycle, the durable append, the seal/flush, the
//! WAL→base-table merge, compaction, scalar-index management, and the LSM read
//! scanner. A concrete store (`RolloutStore`, `DatagenStore`, `ContextStore`)
//! is then only a *schema* plus an encode/decode pair on top of it.
//!
//! # Rollout semantics are the contract
//!
//! The behavior here is `RolloutStore`'s, verbatim — it was the only one of the
//! three fixed-schema stores with a complete and correct implementation of all
//! of the above. Every store that adopts this base therefore gets the same
//! answer to the questions the three used to answer differently:
//!
//! - **`add` is a durable `put` and nothing else.** It reuses a *resident*
//!   writer (epoch claimed once, object-store connection pooled) and retries
//!   exactly once on a fence. It does **not** seal, so concurrent appends are
//!   not serialized behind one seal+drain — and correspondingly it offers **no
//!   read-your-write guarantee**. Visibility is [`StorageBase::flush`]'s job.
//! - **Merge is surgical.** It drains only the generations it actually merged,
//!   reusing the shard's current epoch (so it never fences the live writer),
//!   and deletes generation directories only *after* the manifest drain.
//! - **Compaction defers index remap**, because the MemWAL index is fieldless
//!   and Lance's inline remap panics on it.
//! - **Every dataset open goes through [`StorageBase::load_with_options`]**, so
//!   storage options and the shared session are never silently dropped.
//!
//! # What stays in the concrete store
//!
//! Anything that needs to know the schema: the Arrow schema itself,
//! record↔`RecordBatch` conversion, filter expressions, projections, and
//! typed read APIs. The base is handed the two things it needs to be
//! schema-agnostic — the merge/primary key column name and (optionally) the
//! latest schema to evolve a base table to — via [`StorageBaseOptions`].
